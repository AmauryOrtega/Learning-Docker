Experience level with Docker.
I've been using docker since the beginning of 2017, I came across docker searching for a quick and easy solution to deploy simple mqtt, IRC or HTTP server. Since then I've been able to make my own images and read others people work and adapt it to my needs, my major experience comes from using turnkey linux's images which provide the expansion of a debian server with the ease of sharing my environment with my co workers in development.

Please tell us why do you want to attend DockerCon Europe?
I want to attend DockerCon to gain more knowledge about DevOps and apply them to my career's final year project which is about providing an infrastructure and workflow in my college so that system engineering's students know what kind of environment developers use outside the academic world. Beside that, I've been enthusiast in tech since I was 10 years old and as I got older I was interested in a career in SysAdmin but I wanted to develop new software, I wanted that merge between development and dealing with servers and infrastructure; a couple years ago I saw the word DevOps and intermediately fell in love, what I was looking for finally had a name in my mind, after weeks of reading I wanted to get practical and no matter where I looked, Docker was there, even tough DockerCon won't give me all knowledge there is to know about Docker, It will give me a chance to meet people beyond my usual reach and see how they use it to improve their communities.

What do you hope to learn at DockerCon Europe?
